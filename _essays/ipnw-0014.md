In the popular imagination, the Great Fire of 1910 is remembered as a heroic battle between man and nature. If you visit the roadside markers in Wallace, Idaho, or the museums of the Silver Valley, the story is presented as a romanticized "crucible" where U.S. Forest Service rangers fought a "red demon" to save the nation's timber. The narrative centers on individual heroism, most notably Ranger Ed Pulaski, who saved his crew by holding them at gunpoint in a mine tunnel as the fire raged over them.[^1] However, this "great man" history obscures the political and industrial machinery that set the stage for the disaster. The 1910 fire was not merely an "act of God"; it was an industrial catastrophe born of colonial arrogance, corporate greed, and the erasure of Indigenous knowledge.

To understand the Big Burn, one must first look at the land’s history of management. For millennia, the Coeur d’Alene, Salish, and Nez Perce peoples managed these forests with "fire stewardship," intentional, low-intensity burns that cleared underbrush and prevented massive fuel buildups. By 1910, the U.S. Forest Service had criminalized these practices, viewing fire not as an ecological necessity but as a military enemy that threatened timber profits. Agency leaders ridiculed Indigenous knowledge as "Paiute forestry," a racist slur used to dismiss controlled burning as primitive.[^2]

This colonial mindset turned the Northern Rockies into a tinderbox, but it was industrial capitalism that lit the match. The "Inland Empire" was an extraction colony, and the primary ignition source for the disaster was the newly constructed Chicago, Milwaukee, and Puget Sound Railway. These coal-powered locomotives, struggling up the steep grades of the Bitterroots, spewed red-hot cinders into the tinder-dry slash piles left by loggers.[^3] While the railroads extracted the wealth, the land paid the price; it is estimated that these trains were responsible for hundreds of small fires that eventually merged into the inferno.[^4]

When the inevitable blowup occurred, the burden of fighting fell not on the timber barons but on the marginalized. The Forest Service emptied the saloons and pool halls of Spokane and Butte, recruiting unemployed immigrants and drifters who had little equipment or experience to dig the fire lines.[^5] When the situation became dire, the federal government deployed the Buffalo Soldiers (the 25th Infantry), a segregated unit of Black troops. Their arrival momentarily doubled the Black population of Idaho.[^6] These men brought order to the chaos, policing the evacuation of Wallace and saving the town of Avery by setting backfires alongside Japanese railroad workers.[^7] These Japanese laborers, just months after celebrating the Emperor’s birthday, worked side-by-side with Black soldiers to save towns that likely would have excluded them in peacetime.

The fire itself exposed the stark class disparities of the region. As the firestorm descended on Wallace, trains were marshaled to evacuate women and children, but the recovery was unequal. The fire incinerated the eastern end of town, often home to the transient workforce and the poor, reducing it to "brick shells and ash."[^8] Even the heroes were discarded once the smoke cleared. Ranger Pulaski, celebrated on bronze plaques today, suffered temporary blindness and permanent respiratory damage from the fire. He spent the rest of his life struggling to receive compensation from the government for his injuries, a bitter reminder that the agency valued his legend more than his life.[^9]

The legacy of 1910 is the silence of the modern forest. The "total suppression" policy enacted after the fire, the "10 A.M. Policy," was a rejection of Indigenous science that has left the West with fuel-choked, unhealthy forests.[^10] Today, the "dog-hair" thickets of the Bitterroots stand as a monument to a policy that tried to outlaw fire, only to ensure that when it returns, it burns hotter and faster than ever before.
