title: Burke Canyon
---

Seven miles east of Wallace, Idaho, is a mineral rich canyon, where the ghost town of Burke sits idly. The silver deposits within the canyon attracted railroads to the region as miners started to occupy the area. Burke’s residents endured hardship, from wildfires and avalanches to brutal working conditions. The town’s settlement was followed by a series of natural disasters which devastated Burke’s infrastructure. Retrieving the forgotten history of this town offers a case study of the labor strife and environmental conditions that made the Silver Valley one of the largest producers of precious metals worldwide, while demonstrating the sorts of violence that occurred during the Gilded Age.[^1]

Burke sits at 3,700 feet above sea level at a latitude of 47.5203 degrees north, and a longitude of 115.8192 degrees west. The canyon stretches three hundred feet at its center, hemmed in by steep mountainsides, and the town is longer than it is wide.[^2] Burke Canyon Creek runs through the canyon floor, which required shop owners to raise their awnings so trains could pass through the town. The narrow canyon is depicted in this [Sanborn map of Burke, Shoshone County Idaho,](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/sanborn/items/burke-1909.html#sanborn-burke-1909-001) where the railroad ran through the town as buildings sat on each side; many buildings were constructed over Burke Canyon Creek.[^3]

A famous example of infrastructural accommodation is the Tiger Hotel. The Tiger hotel was built in 1887, originally holding 150 rooms and standing three stories tall. The hotel was famous for its unique layout, composed of two distinct sections. The old section of the boarding house was built in 1888, and the large addition was added in 1915. The narrow canyon required the hotel lobby to be split by the railroad. Five passenger trains passed through the building each day.[^4] This shows the determination of the people who lived in Burke, who found creative solutions to problems caused by limited space on the canyon floor.

The determination of the residents of Burke to thrive in a small canyon is apparent by the many natural disasters that tore through the holler. The image, [Group of people gathered at Hercules Mine after snowslide Burke, Idaho,](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/cities/items/cities748.html) shows a large crowd of onlookers facing the destruction of a snowslide. The image presents houses smothered in snow and rubble. These were common; Burke’s first recorded avalanche in 1890 killed three people.[^5] Fires have also devastated the canyon, as shown in the photo [Burke, Idaho Fire](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/tabor/items/tabor2962.html).[^6] The image shows the aftermath of the fire that destroyed much of Burke in 1923. The photograph shows smoke filling up the canyon, while debris sits dormant scorched by fire. The fire destroyed fifty businesses and halted important industries in the canyon such as mining when, “Four hundred and forty miners were forced to flee to the depths of the Hecla lead and silver mine.” The mine was closed for five months as the infrastructure was rebuilt.[^7]

Burke is important in the story and legacy of the Coeur D’ Alene Mining Wars. Silver mining in the Coeur d’ Alene mining district had halted by 1892, as many mines were going out of business because the price of lead and silver were declining, and freight costs were rising.[^8] Owners started offering miners work at a lower pay than was originally granted.[^9] Tensions in Burke rose in July of 1892, when workers of the Tiger-Poorman mine went on strike against decreased wages and the poor food quality provided by the company.[^10] Attempting to break up the strike, the owners advertised the strikers’ jobs in Midwestern newspapers. The owners had hired Pinkerton agents as bodyguards for the scab workers coming from the Midwest. The fighting in Burke became so extreme, then Idaho governor Norman Willey would declare martial law. It was in effect for four months, and hundreds of soldiers were sent into the canyon to stop the conflict.[^11]

The labor conflicts surrounding Burke Canyon is important to the legacy of labor violence in northern Idaho. The Coeur d’ Alene mining wars, though not discussed as widely as other labor conflicts like the Battle of Blair Mountain, was significant to the region and the nation. The history of Burke contained a struggle that’s present today with the ongoing class strife within extractive industries. The town of Burke encapsulates the struggles Idaho mining communities faced in the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> century, ecologically and economically.
