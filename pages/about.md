## About CollectionBuilder CSV

Most people think of Portlandia or Seattle as a ecotopic microcosm of the Pacific Northwest while their imaginations skip over the interior portion of the region. If people think of the Inland Northwest--the region stretching from the Cascades to southern Oregon and from Spokane to southwestern Montana--they tend to think of it as empty, forlorn, or a hotbed of radical politics with a homogenous population. In fact, the inland northwest has ancient histories and great diversity of peoples and landscapes. 

This digital Peoples' Guide seeks to fill in the gaps by drawing attention inland from the coast to feature the rich histories and diverse peoples through short place stories from throughout the Interior Pacific Northwest region of North America. 

Students in Dr. Alyssa Kreikemeier's History of Idaho and the Pacific Northwest class have curated multi-media sources and written stories about places that showcase the diverse peoples and places of an often overlooked or misunderstood region of the United States.
